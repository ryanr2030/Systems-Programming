Ryan Reynolds 2693018 Question 4 Debug Report
	Logic Error:
		in the nested if statement i needs to be incremented to the
		character location of the first instance where
		word[i]!=word[i+j] i.e the character after the last 			consecutive match. Setting i=i+j followed by a continue 		statement iterates the loop to check the character
		after the last statement
