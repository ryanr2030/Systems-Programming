First output: Raining
	parent process outputs raining because i=child pid and j=0
2nd output: Cats
	child process outputs Cats because the i=fork() returns 0 for the 		newly created child process and j is initialized at 0 for the for 		loop
3rd output: Raining
	the parent process outputs raining because j=1 and i=child process
	id
4th output: Dogs
	the child process outputs dogs because j=1 but i=0 because it is
	the child process
5th output: Raining
	the parent process outputs raining because j=2 and i=child process
	id
6th: Dogs
	the child process outputs Dogs because j=2 but remains 0. This appears after the terminal shell prompt because the parent finishes before the child due to the 3 second delay in the "Cats" output.
